# w-miki

This is a simple MongoDB datastore-based and Node.js http-based wiki initially
created during a Coding Dojo held on one of the Macei√≥ MongoDB User Group
meetups.

The name came from Mongodb-WIKI converted to m-wiki and then replacing _m_ and
_w_ (the same trick used to generate the Wario name).

All dependencies are automatically managed by npm using the package.json file.
You can install the dependencies with the command `npm install` under this
directory.

To run the app, just run `npm start`. This command will execute the file
`server.js`. Make sure MongoDB is running when you start w-miki.
